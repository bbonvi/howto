# Rust Design Principles
- **Prefer simplicity over cleverness.** Always choose readability and maintainability over clever abstractions.
- **Embrace immutability and data ownership.** Use `&` and `&mut` judiciously.
- **Isolate unsafe code.** Any use of `unsafe` should be tightly scoped, well-commented, and encapsulated.
